# Fractal DEX

Fractal DEX aims to become the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the new zkSync Era Chain. Our mission is to provide the ecosystem with seamless trading experiences, deep liquidity, and strategic partnerships that foster the growth of DeFi in a user-friendly manner. 

## Key Features

- Low Slippage: We prioritize minimizing slippage to ensure fair and efficient trades for our users.
- Deep Liquidity: Our DEX will maintain substantial liquidity pools, enabling seamless trading with minimal price impact.
- Enhanced UI: We have revamped the traditional VE (Vote Escrow) model UI, addressing bugs and eliminating error boxes, resulting in a smoother and faster user interface.
- Longevity and Reliability: We place utmost importance on building a platform that ensures long-term sustainability, ease of use, and consistent performance.
- Transparency and Security: Fractal DEX upholds transparency as a fundamental principle, and we employ robust security measures to safeguard user assets.
- User Safety: We prioritize user safety and implement stringent protocols to protect user accounts and funds.

## Future Enhancements

In addition to the aforementioned improvements, we are committed to enhancing the overall user experience in the following ways:

1. Intuitive User Interface: We will continuously refine and optimize the user interface to ensure a seamless and intuitive trading experience.
2. Advanced Trading Features: We will introduce advanced trading functionalities such as limit orders, stop-loss orders, and margin trading to cater to the diverse needs of our users.
3. Community Engagement: We believe in fostering an active and engaged community. We will establish channels for user feedback, community discussions, and incentivized programs to encourage participation and collaboration.
4. Integration of New Tokens: As the Lore Chain ecosystem expands, we will actively seek partnerships and integrate new tokens, providing users with a wider range of trading options.
5. Education and Resources: We will develop educational materials, tutorials, and resources to empower users with knowledge and help them make informed trading decisions.
